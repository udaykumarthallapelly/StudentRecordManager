## 💡 Features
- Add, view, search, delete student records
- GPA-based ranking using BST in-order traversal
- ID-based fast search using HashMap
- Console UI using Scanner
- Encapsulated, modular design using OOP

## 🛠️ DSA Concepts Used
- LinkedList
- HashMap
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Recursion for tree traversal
